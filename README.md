# hello-world

Hello.

I'm completely new, but looking forward to learning all things.  Right now, my career is pretty much non-tech related and I'd like to change that. Really stagnent in a job role, but the hunger to learn more is pretty frustrating when opportunities to learn or involve yourself in a role at your work seem just out of reach.

I don't know what kinds of projects will be worked on here.  As I learn, I'm sure some kind of inspiration will strike and followed by lots of trial and error.  There's a myriad of sources on the Internet to learn and unfortunately life cannot afford formal academic training.  The financial risk is too great at this point in my life, so I'll start small/free and work my way up.

Initial learning Goals: HTML, CSS, Js, Python, and building a simple website.

Outside of the Internet I enjoy: Analog photography, collecting records, fixing/upgrading vintage audio equipment, and walking my dog.

Help & advice is always welcome. Thanks for reading.
